Data for “mydata2.txt” were derived from this publication:
[1] Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. 21th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, ESANN 2013. Bruges, Belgium 24-26 April 2013. 

The following are variables for the “mydata.txt” data file:

[1] subject : the subject number from 1-30 of the individuals tested
[2] label :  the label of the activity that was being performed. There are 6 different possibilities labeled 
	1.WALKING
	2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	4 SITTING
	5 STANDING
	6 LAYING
The following data are the means of all the measurements with the gyroscope (with units rad/seg) for each variable listed for each individual and each activity. There were 30 individuals each performing 6 activities resulting in 180 means calculated for each of the following 66 variables. The measurement being made is given by the variable name.
